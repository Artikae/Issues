Well, see, I was running low on Gold Coins so I though I'd hop into the nether for some PvP.
I found a glitch upon entering the nether
I can't be hurt.
I can't cast spells.
I can't chat.
I can't use any commands.
I can't fly.
However, I can punch people and hurt them
I can be knocked back.

Relogging does not fix it.
It doesn't affect any other worlds or the lobby, only the nether. 
I don't know how it happened nor how to recreate it.
